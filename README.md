# findUs

An app to find Waldo(for now).
Using react-icons,react-bootstrap and useContext.

1. Learning to use useContext for state management.
2. Used react-router-dom for navigating to different links.
3. Learnt to use react-bootstrap to its full power.
4. Keeping web color consistent, to appear nice.
5. Learnt to use firebase
6. Had a hard time figuring out coordinate, but after going through tons of stackoverflow answers and googling, I did it. :)

Inspired by a medium article on data science which said that computer will always find the object faster.
